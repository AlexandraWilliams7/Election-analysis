## Challenge Overview
### Election votes by county
The purpose of this challenge was to write a script to show the votes based on the counties. The written script should also produce the percentage of votes by county and the county with the largest turnout. With the county script, the output should answer the following:
- The amount and percentage of votes cast in each county.
- The county with the largest turnout of voters.
The script was written using new variables, list, and dictionaries for counties based on the examples from the candidate portion. The script also included loops, ifs, and save fucntions based on the candidate examples. 


## Challenge Summary
### Results
The analysis from the county vote script shows the following results:
- The county votes:
   - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
   - Denver: 73.8% (306,055)
   - Arapahoe: 6.7 (24,801)
- The county with the largest turnout was:
   **- Denver**

Now that the script has been created, the Colorado Board of Elections can use it to find the outcome of the elections as well as the votes in each county.
The Board can also adjust the script to determine how many votes a candidate received in each county or use it on a larger scale to run the results of multiple elections at once.
